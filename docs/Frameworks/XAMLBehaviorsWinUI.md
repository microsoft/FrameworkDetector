# XAML Behaviors for WinUI (XBWinUI)

## Summary

XAML Behaviors are easy-to-use means of adding common and reusable interactivity to your WinUI applications with minimal code. It's a commonly used addition to XAML originating from WPF with the Microsoft Blend application. Meant to be a core pillar of how XAML allowed designers and developers to work together in parallel.

### Languages

**Framework Languages:** C# (formerly C++ as well)

**App Languages:** C# and other .NET languages

### OS Support

TBD

### Dependencies

The XAML Behaviors depends on either:

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)

### Canonical Apps

**.NET:**

- [Windows Community Toolkit Gallery](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4tlcq)

## How to Detect

TBD

### Runtime Detection

TBD

Prior to v3.0.0 the XAML Behaviors were also compiled for C++ developers.

Note: There is also an older version of this library for WPF, we probably want that as an independent detector?

### Static Detection

It is not possible to definitively determine the use of the XAML Behaviors by an app by detecting the presence or absence of the aforementioned module file(s) within the app's binaries. In the simplest case, any of the aforementioned module(s) could have been included mistakenly.
