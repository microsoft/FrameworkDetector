# XAML Behaviors for WinUI

## Summary

Win2D is an easy-to-use Windows Runtime API for immediate mode 2D graphics rendering with GPU acceleration. It is available to C#, C++ and VB developers writing apps for the Windows Universal Platform (UWP) or Windows App SDK. It utilizes the power of Direct2D, and integrates seamlessly with XAML and CoreWindow.
